# Hi, I'm @DogDad65 👋

🍇 **From Winemaking to Web Development**  
After years of experience in the wine production industry, I'm now transitioning into the tech world. My journey into coding began 3 years ago through online learning platforms like Udemy and Coursera, and now I'm finishing a 12-week immersive Software Engineering bootcamp with General Assembly. I'm passionate about applying the same creativity and attention to detail from winemaking into building robust, user-friendly applications.

🐍 **Learning Python**  
I’m also expanding my knowledge into Python to explore its potential in data analysis, scripting, and back-end development.

🌱 **Currently Learning**  
- Full-stack development with JavaScript, React, Node.js, and MongoDB
- Building RESTful APIs and exploring new frontend frameworks
- Continuing to expand my knowledge of Python, data structures, and algorithms

👨‍💻 **Skills & Technologies**  
- HTML | CSS | JavaScript | React | Node.js | MongoDB
- Python | Git | GitHub | Postman
